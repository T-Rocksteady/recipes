Ingredients:
- 2 cups almond flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- >1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 table spoons melted grass fed organic butter
- 5 tblsp Erithrytol (or Agave nectar)
- 1/2 cup frozen blueberries 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Take a 12 piece muffin pan and place cupcake papers in each individual muffin hole.

2. In a medium size bowl mix the almond flour with the rest of the dry ingredients.

3. Beat the eggs lightly and pour them into a separate bowl. Mix in the sour cream, coconut milk, and melted butter until smooth. I suggest to use a handheld mixer with a whisker, just because it’s so easy and saves you a lot of time and effort.

4. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients and use the handheld mixer to make a smooth batter.

5. Fold half the amount of blueberries into the batter and start distributing the mixture evenly into the muffin cups. This batter will not rise a lot in the oven so you can fill almost the entire paper cup.

6. Take the remaining amount of blueberries and place some on top of each muffin evenly.  Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden. Let it cool down, and then serve with grass fed butter.
